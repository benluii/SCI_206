traditional projectors use lamps
- use a quartz rod (integrator rod) to create a tophat light distribution instead of a guassain one
- lifetime of lamps around 4months
- switching to lasers which have a lifetime of 30,000 hourss
- colour gamut size:
    HDTV<DCI projector<OLED/laser
- light valve
    - tiny mirrors that reflect light to/away from the projector to display images 

- using IR to detect veins
    - IR is used to detect veins (blood absorbs IR much more than surrounding tissue)
    - the reflected IR is recorded and interpreted
    - then RGB is used to display a humassn visible image back onto the skin
        - the bright RGB areas are IR aborbed areas
        - dark RGB areas are IR reflected areas
        - basically inverse
