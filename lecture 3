Pressure

- pressure = force / area
- factors that increase pressure
    - temperature
        - higher temperatures increase kinetic energy -> more force, more pressure
    - density
        - higher density, more particles, higher pressure 
    - this is represented as PV = nRT
        - i.e. pressure is proportional to density of particles X temperature

- buoyancy
    - archimedes' principle
        - an object immersed in a fluid has an upward force equal to the weight of the fluid it displaces

- hot air balloon
    - pressure of air inside = pressure outside
    - but temperature of air inside > temp of air outside
    - therefore density inside < density outside 

- regular balloon
    - tension of the balloon increases the pressure of the air inside
    - the 2 balances each other

- helium balloon
    - if weight of helium+balloon < air then balloon rises

- bubbles
    - made of surfactant molecules
    - basically water is pinched between the heads of the surfactant molecules
