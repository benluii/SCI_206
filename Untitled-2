SCI 206

lecture 1

- newton's laws
- throw ball, at different stages, what is the force, acceleration?
- horizontal force does not effect vertical forces in terms of speed, only direction (velocity)

Lecture 2

- momemtum = mass*velocity
- elastic vs non-elastic collisions
- conservation of momemtum
- friction
    - static
    - kinetic
- circular motion
    - centripedal
    - centrifugal
    
Lecture 3 - Resonance 

- transverse vs longitudinal waves 
- wave terminology (wavelength, speend, frequency, period)
- doppler effect  (does pitch increase/decreas as sound moves away/towards you?)
- resonance timing, harmonics
