    Electromagnetism Recap:
        - sources of electric fields
            - electric charges and subatomic particles
            - moving magnetic pole
            - changing magnetic fields 
        - sources of magnetic fields 
            - magnetic poles and subatomic particles
            - moving electric charge
            - changing electric fields  

        - electric fields contain energy 

                      electricFeild^2 * volume 
            energy = ---------------------------
                     8*(3.14~) * coulombConstant

        Flux Capacitor 
            - 2 electrically charged plates
            - creates an electric field b/w the 2 plates 
            - when electric charges are being dispelled, a magnetic field is temporarily created 
        
    RADIO 

        Transmitter
            - communicates via electromagnetic waves 
            - these waves are created by accelerating electric charges along an antenna
            - accelerating electric charges produce a special mixture of electric + magnetic fields 
            - these fields can travel long distances through empty space
            - radio waves are a subset of electromagnetic waves 
                - characterized by low frequencies and long wavelengths 

        Tank Circuits
            - amplifies the strength of the transmitter 
            - uses resonant energy transfer (i.e. harmonic oscillation)
                - i.e. increases the strength of the wave by "giving the charge a push synchronized with its rhythmic frequency"
            - recall: period isn't affected by amplitude
            - period depends on the capacitor and inductor
                - capacitor: 
                    - holds charge
                    - larger the capacitor, longer the time for a charge to move through the circuit 
                - inductor:
                    - opposes current changes
                    - larger the inductance, longer the time for the current to start and stop

        Communication (Radio Waves)
            - scenario: transmitting antenna -> receiving antenna 
            Q:  How does the receiving antenna distinguish the transmitting antenna's radio waves from random thermal motion/electric noise?
            A:  Move the charge at at a particular rhythm, thereby creating waves at a particular frequency 
                This helps distinguish the transmission from random noise 
            - at close distances, the charges from the transmitting antenna directly affect the charges on the receiving antenna
            - at long distances, the charge must be carried via radio wave 
            Radio Waves:
                - can travel through empty space
                - travels at the speed of light 
                - series of alternating electric and magnetic fields that self reproduce 
                - electric field is perpendicular to the magnetic field
                    * Vertical Polarization
                        - when the electric field is vertical
                    * Horizontal Polarization
                        - when the electric field is horizontal
                - wavelength is usually â‰¥ 1 meter 

        Antennas
            - usually halfwave dipole or quarter-wave monopole antenna 
            - strongest portion of radio wave is sent out perpendicular to antenna orientation
            - orientation of antenna should match the transmitted wave's polarization 
            - FM radio + TV broadcasts
                - usually uses circularly polarized waves (combination of vertical and horizontal polarizations)
                - typically short-wavelength 
            - AM radio 
                - only use vertical polarization
                - only long-wavelength 
        
        Sound Representation 
            - sound wave is combinations of compression and rarefractions of air 
            * AM (amplitude modulation)
                - amplitude == amount of charge moving up/down antenna 
                - uses large amplitudes to represent compressions
                - uses small amplitudes to represent rarefractions
                - uses some kind of amplitude threshold to represent avg air pressure (?)
            * FM (frequency modulation)
                - frequency == times the charge moves up/down antenna 
                - uses higher frequencies to represent compression
                - uses lower frequencies to represent rarefractions
                - changes in frequencies are very small 

        Bandwith (for radio)
            - different services are allocated different ranges in the frequncy spectrum
            - in USA:
                - AM => 550 kHz and 1600 kHz
                - FM => 88 MHz and 108 MHz
                - TV, police, aircraft etc occupy the other frequencies
            - in order to prevent conflicting transmissions, radio stations are allocated subranges in their respective frequency range (aka bandwidth)
                * AM stations are allocated 10kHz of bandwidth (5kHz above/below its carrier frequency)
                * FM stations are allocated 200kHz of bandwidth (100kHz above/below its carrier frequency)
                - as such FM radio can do better at transmitting music
                - however, AM radio has better range 
            - spectrum bandwidth for signals transmitted in cables are virually unrestricted since signal is isolated
                - i.e. no competing noise 
                
    TELEVISION TUBE

        - uses CRT (Cathode Ray Tube) tech
        - consists of:
            - cathode grid
                - warmed by a nearby filament when the TV is turned on
                - heat tosses the electrons towards the anode through a grid 
            - anode
                - positively charged
                - attracts the electrons that make it past the grid 
            - focusing coil
                - uses a magnetic field to align/focus the electrons in the right direction
            - deflecting coil
                - bends the electrons in the precise direction it needs to hit the phosphor screen 
            - phosphor screen
                - bright white is produced when the electrons react with the phosphor
                - to create grays, the negative charge on the cathode grid is increased, reducing the amount of electrons that make it past
                - less electrons hitting the phosphor screen == less reaction == less white (gray)
        - this process happens in a horizontal sweep, from top to bottom
        - a full sweep takes 1/30 seconds, which is detectable by the human eye as a flicker
        - to prevent this, alternate sweeps through even/odd rows, effectively make a "full sweep" every 1/60 seconds 

        Colour
            - phosphor screen is now an arrangement of RGB reactive phosphor dots
            - for each arrangement of 3 dots, we have 3 electron guns
            - shadow mask is used to to screen for the appropiate colour 
            - shadow mask is easily magnetized, so you should keep magnets away from colour CRTs
