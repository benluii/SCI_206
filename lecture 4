Static Electricity

- common rhetoric is that current moves from + to -
- what really happens is - to +
- Ohm's Law
    - V = I * R
    - voltage = current * resistance
- Power
    - P = V * I 
    - power = voltage * current 

- conductors
    - has a postitive temperature coefficient
    - this means that as temperature goes up, resistance goes up
    - number of free electrons is independent to temp, but atoms start colliding
- semiconductors
    - has negative temperature coefficient
    - this means that as temperature goes up, resistance goes down
    - number of free electrons drastically go up as temp goes up, outweighing the atom collision factor

- AC
    - current changes direction
    - voltage fluctuates like a sine graph
    - power we get delivered to homes
    - need a convertor to convert AC->DC
- DC
    - current direction is constant
    - volatage is constant 
    - the type of power most electronics run on

- electro magnets 
    - electric current makes a magnetic field
    - strength of field depends on current and number of windings
    - iron has magnetic domains that are normally randomly oriented
    - these magnetic domains are typically oriented with a electric coil to amplify the magnetic strength of both

- producing energy with magnets
    - changing magnetic field induces an electric field
    - lenz's law: current induced by a changing magnetic field always produces a magnetic field that opposes the change
    - so pushing a magnet into a coil requires work, this work is converted into electrical energy 

- fuses
    - melts and breaks the circuit when current or resistance gets too high
    - protects the load from overloading
- circuit breaker
    - consists of a bimetallic strip (2 strips of metal that expand at diff rates attached together)
    - when the current is low, the strip lies flat, completing the circuit
    - when the current gets too high, the metal expands, pulling contacts apart, and breaking the circuit
- ground fault circuit interrupter (GFCI)
    - live and neutral wires pass through a coil, wrapped around a solenoid 
    - solenoid is attached to a switch that completes the circuit
    - idea is that both currents are balanced to cancel each other out 
    - once the live wire gets too hot (current gets too high), a magnetic field is induced, and the solenoid opens the switch
    - this breaks the circuit
