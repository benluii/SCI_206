Resonance

- transverse waves
    - waves moving along string (string moves up/down)
- longitudinal waves
    - waves moving through spring 
    - sound
    - typically defined as regions of low/high pressure

- V = F x L
    - speed of wave = frequency x wavelength

- doppler effect
    - as sound source moves towards listener, less distance between source and listener, which means smaller wavelengths
    - since speed of sound is constant, smaller waverlength results in higher frequency

- oscillations
    - pendulums (transverse oscillations)
        - period of a pendulum only depends on length of string (not weight of pendulum)
        - longer the string, longer the period, lower the frequency (rate at which its swinging stays constant)
    - mass on spring (longitudinal oscillations)
        - period (and frequency) depends on mass and stiffness of spring
        - bigger the mass, lower the frequency
        - stiffer the spring, higher the frequency

- resonant frequency
    - the natural frequency at which an oscillation prefers to oscillate
    - applying energy at the same frequency increases amplitude of oscillation

- sound from a wine glass
    - when the rim of a wine glass is rubbed, the bowl of the glass moves in and out
    - this moves the air back and forth, creating a pressure wave known as SOUND
    - no air, no sound 

- sound from a tube/ bottle
    -  pressure wave is like a mass on a spring
    - the air is the mass+spring
    - frequency depends on the depth of the tube 
    - fundamental wavelength = 2x tube length
